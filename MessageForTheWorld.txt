Note to instructors and all reading the code: this project was active since its released
and was updated locally very often with uploads when major features were implemented.
On the last day of submission, with the project already done, both I (Yazet Sepulveda) and my partner (Juan Diaz) suffered  
from bugs with eclipse were it didnt want to recognize our Main.Launch and the game wouldnt launch. 
Most of these issues were fixed via trial and error, and instructor tips, but we eneded up having to copy paste everything
and delete the entire local repository to restore from a previous state here on GitHub. The game has some issues with the
music as I wasnt able to upload the final files as they were too large, and eclipse would not let me push the updated version that switched to the original song.
I had a lot a fun during this project and regardless of my grade, I am glad I got to work with together with my partner to create something that has a little bit of
both of us. I am glad I chose this career and I wish to inspire others into following their passions as well. Thank you for 
the opportunity and I hope you enjoy the feautres that got into the final version!

Sincerely, Yazet
